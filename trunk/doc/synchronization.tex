\section{Synchronization}
\label{sec:Synchronization}
Synchronization is one of the significant element in a distributed system. The issue in our Teledroid application is that the file after replacement will generate a new modified time, which is the current time and later than the file on the other side. Thus, file on the other side will be replaced and also generate a newer modified time. Again and again, that file will be transferred back and forth even without any content modification. This is the result of applying the modified time as a key to the file comparison. We could employ checksum in our system, this might relieve the issue a little. However, the checksum approach has a hard time to cope with distinguishing the new and the deleted files. So now, our working version only support comparison with the modified time. Our solution so far is that the new generated file will not has the current time as the modified time. Instead, it will be assigned with the modified time of that modified file on the other side. In this way, Teledroid will prevent from transferring files back and forth and become more efficient.
