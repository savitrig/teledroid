Modern mobile devices have significant synchronization requirements.  With storage in the gigabytes, these devices can carry a users' music collection, photos, videos, and other data.  As sensors and software progress, they're increasingly used to produce and download this material directly as well.  As this trend continues, the need for more frequent synchronization of this data between a user's mobile device and computer will become more pressing.

We performed a feasibility study of real-time, wireless synchronization.  By utilizing filesystem monitors present in the Android operating system and modern desktop operating systems we aimed to keep resource usage reasonable.
