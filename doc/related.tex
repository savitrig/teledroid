There have been massive research on mobile device synchronization with different purpose. In our \teledroid\ project, 
we set up our goal to provide a mobile environment to access the cloud computing elements anywhere and anytime. We have 
looked into some other researches which have different goals but related with our project.

There's a research aimed at managing multiple devices in mobile information work~\cite{Oulasvirta:2007p1727}, which 
also need to satisfy the need of information synchronization. Some researches focus on the collaborative backup 
service~\cite{Courtes:2006p1734}, which have the problem of synchronization between different client when the backup 
copy is shared among multiple active client. We also noticed there is a hybrid approach to optimistic file system 
directory tree synchronization~\cite{Lindholm:2005p1760}. which mixed the two main approaches to optimistic file system 
synchronization: distributed file systems and file synchronizers. Also, we find a synchronization framework for personal mobile servers~\cite{Sinitsyn:2004p1738}, the high-level object-based storage API defined in this 
project is very much enlightening. We may as well provide APIs to allow other applications to control the \teledroid\ service.

However, in our primitive implementation, we choose to use the simplest way.
