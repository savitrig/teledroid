\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}


Our paper is organized as follows:\\
Section~\ref{sec:Motivation} describes the motivation behind the \teledroid\ project.
Section~\ref{sec:Architecture} describes the architecture and gives a high level overview of the components of the project.
Section~\ref{sec:Implementation} goes into detail of the implementation of our system.
In section~\ref{sec:Performance}, we present the results of our experiments to evaluate the performance of \teledroid, and compare the performance differences between filesystem monitoring modes.
After the discussion of related work in section~\ref{sec:Related}, we conclude and present our possible future work 
in section~\ref{sec:Conclusions}.

{\bf Acknowledgments}  We would like to thank Dr. Greg Benson for providing guidance and advice and for pushing us to take on more ambitious work, and the kind folks of irc://chat.freenode.net/#concatenative, who helped debug an old GCC, an incomplete version of glibc, and a generally troublesome server environment.
