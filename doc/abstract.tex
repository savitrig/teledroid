	In this paper we present \teledroid, a synchronization service for android to aid the need of making use of cloud 
computing facilities to get more powerful computational ability and faster execution with longer battery life. \\

\teledroid\ use a SSH connection between server and mobile device to communicate and determine the files to be transfered. 
A simple SCP implementation was included in \teledroid\ to conduct the task of transfer files. \teledroid\ employes the 
operating system feature of monitoring file changes in file systems, which in Linux is inotify, to trace file system 
changes. The changes from both local and remote will then be analyzed and generate the file changes list and syntonization 
 action list. We use several techniques to prevent ping-pong syntonization, including temporary unregistering file from inotify when transfer file and touching the file modification time after transfer. \\

We conduct experiments in the paper to find out whether \verb+inotify+ could provide performance advantages over 
traditional file scan method.
