title = {A synchronization framework for personal mobile servers},
abstract = {The recent growth in the mobile device market has proven the feasibility of mobile storage based consumer electronics products. One of the key features of personal mobile storage devices is the ability to synchronize content and metadata with other mobile and stationary devices. The main problem addressed is automatic data exchange and synchronization in the domain of personal mobile storage devices or personal servers. We present a synchronization framework for personal servers delivered in the form of user scenarios, derived system requirements, design decisions and a software components structure. The synchronization framework was validated through a working prototype which shows added functionality, such as: connectivity with various types of devices from different vendors, synchronization based on user preferences, content-aware synchronization filtering. In order to abstract from implementation specifics of different network protocols, a high-level object-based storage API has been defined.},

title = {Storage Tradeoffs in a Collaborative Backup Service for Mobile Devices},
abstract = {Mobile devices are increasingly relied on but are used in contexts that put them at risk of physical damage, loss or theft. We consider a fault-tolerance approach that exploits spontaneous interactions to implement a collaborative backup service. We define the constraints implied by the mobile environment, analyze how they translate into the storage layer of such a backup system and examine various design options. The paper concludes with a presentation of our prototype implementation of the storage layer, an evaluation of the impact of several compression methods, and directions for future work},

title = {A hybrid approach to optimistic file system directory tree synchronization},
abstract = {There are two main approaches to optimistic file system synchronization: distributed file systems and file synchronizers. The former type is characterized by a log-based approach that depends on access to file system internals, the latter by a state-based approach that utilizes the standard file system interface, which limits the efficiency of change detection.We propose a hybrid approach that 1) defines a minor extension to the semantics of the file system interface that enables efficient state-based file system change detection and 2) employs selectively instantiated XML documents to make the use of state-based algorithms for optimistic synchronization feasible on large file systems.The hybrid approach is simple, well-suited for current file system architectures, and allows us to leverage existing state-based reconciliation algorithms. An initial implementation shows our approach to be feasible, lightweight, and interoperable and to have satisfactory performance},

title = {Mobile kits and laptop trays: managing multiple devices in mobile information work},
abstract = {A study at a large IT company shows that mobile information workers frequently migrate work across devices (here: smartphones, desktop PCs, laptops). While having multiple devices provides new opportunities to work in the face of changing resource deprivations, the management of devices is often problematic. The most salient problems are posed by 1) the physical effort demanded by various management tasks, 2) anticipating what data or functionality will be needed, and 3) aligning these efforts with work, mobility, and social situations. Workers' strategies of coping with these problems center on two interwoven activities: the physical handling of devices and cross-device synchronization. These aim at balancing risk and effort in immediate and subsequent use. Workers also exhibit subtle ways to handle devices in situ, appropriating their physical and operational properties. The design implications are discussed.},
